# ES+VIX Divergence Engine — Old vs New Model

## Core Idea
When ES and VIX diverge:
- ES up + VIX down → Long ES
- ES down + VIX up → Short ES
- Otherwise → No trade

## Old Model
- No ATR filter
- No VIX regime filter
- Trades through news
- High profit, higher risk

## New Model
- Adds ATR(14) filter
- Adds VIX regime filter
- Skips dangerous days
- Capped compounding
- Safer, smoother, more teachable

## Summary
Old = raw power.  
New = controlled mastery.  
We use the upgraded model in the Lab.
